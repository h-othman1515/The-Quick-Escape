## 🛡️ The Quick Escape.
A suspenseful 2D platformer built with the Godot Engine. Navigate a dark, ancient labyrinth where your survival depends on speed and strategy rather than the strength of your sword.

## 🕹️ The Concept
You play as a young, agile knight trapped in a cursed stone palace. This isn't a traditional combat game; it is a High-Stakes Stealth experience. You must navigate narrow passages, avoid deadly environmental traps, and outsmart the "Departed Guardians"—skeletons that patrol the halls.

Mind Over Blade: Study enemy patterns and plan your route.

Agile Movement: Use your youthful speed to dash through closing paths.

Atmospheric Survival: Manage your light and stamina to find the exit before the darkness consumes you.
